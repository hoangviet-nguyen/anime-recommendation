    "### Building a Recommender System with Scikit-learn\n",
    "This notebook focuses on implementing a custom recommender system. The primary objective is to build a generalized model capable of recommending items based on the training data provided. We will leverage the scikit-learn API to compare and evaluate different models to determine the most effective approach for our recommendation task. For more detailed information on using the scikit-learn API, visit the [scikit-learn developer guide.](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html)"
